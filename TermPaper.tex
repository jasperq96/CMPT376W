Two different laws affect the system: laws on data protection that govern the confidentiality of personal information and mental health laws that govern the compulsory detention of patients deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. These constraints must be taken into consideration when designing this system to see what patient information can and cannot be stored. As for software dependencies, this system does not have any as it is more like a stand-alone program.\par

\tab The MHC-PMS is designed to run on a laptop, so that it may be accessed and used from sites that do not have secure network connectivity. This system is not a complete medical records system and does not maintain information about other medical conditions. However, it can interact / exchange data with other clinical information systems.\par

\tab As the MHC-PMS system relies on a database to function, an SQL-based database is a necessity. For operating systems, Windows 7 or 10 is required. The main database will be stored on the cloud with a system that meets these requirements. \par

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3.4 \hspace*{10pt}Communications Interfaces}
\setlength{\parskip}{12.0pt}
From a nurse or doctors perspective, this would be a stand-alone program they can open and connect to the main network with. They will be able to open up electronic forms to add / edit / view patient information and view administrative details. This data will be pulled from the cloud which is hosted on a seperate computer, and can be stored offline to make a local copy of the database. \par

From a privacy perspective, there are some issues. Privacy is easiest to maintain when there is only a single copy of the system data. However to ensure availability in the event of server failure or when disconnected from a network, multiple copies of data should be maintained. This way there is less chance of data being lost completely, but the risk of information being stolen is higher.\par

4.4.1\  \tab Description and Priority\par

(Medium Priority) Allows doctors to schedule patients.\par

4.4.2\  \tab Stimulus/Response Sequences\par

By clicking the top left drop down menu, the user can then click the tab for scheduling. They will be directed to a page that will ask for the name and identification number of the user (only doctors/therapists have access to this section). If a valid name and identification number is submitted, an interactive calendar of the provided username will be displayed, in which the user can then click on specific dates to add/remove appointments. When a day is clicked, a small pop-up window will display the current appointments. If an appointment is clicked, another small pop-up window will show the time of the appointment along with the patient's name and mental problem. This window allows the user to modify the time, or completely delete the appointment. To exit the smaller pop-up windows the user can click anywhere outside of the pop-up windows border. Once the user has finished with their scheduling, they can save it by clicking the save button located on the bottom right corner or just close the window.\par

\subsection*{5.1\ \ \ \  Performance Requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.1\ \ \ \  Performance Requirements}
If the main patient database is held on a single server / computer, then problems may arise if that computer crashes or stops functioning. A solution to this may be to host this database on multiple servers, so that if one crashes then there are still others functional. Preferably hosted in different buildings, so that an electrical outage in one neighborhood would not be a problem. The cluster of systems should be able to update each other when presented with new information. \par

\subsection*{5.2 \hspace*{10pt}Safety Requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.2 \hspace*{10pt}Safety Requirements}
From the nature of this software system, patients may potentially be harmed if incorrect information was inputted into the database. A safeguard would be that when entering or editing patient information, there would be a double-check window that pops up after submitting the form. Also, as some mental illnesses cause patients to become suicidal or a danger to other people, the system will warn medical staff about these potentially dangerous patients.\par

\subsection*{5.3 \hspace*{10pt}Security Requirements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.3 \hspace*{10pt}Security Requirements}
One concern would be that unauthorized personnel may physically access the system. A workaround for this can be that after a certain amount of time (for example when the computer goes into screensaver mode) then it would prompt the user to re-enter their credentials. And as stated above in section 5.1, multiple copies of the database must be preserved as the data must be available when needed or else a safety hazard may occur. This leads to a higher risk of data being stolen, and additional security measures must be put into place to prevent this from happening.\par

\subsection*{5.4 \hspace*{10pt}Software Quality Attributes}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5.4 \hspace*{10pt}Software Quality Attributes}

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Adaptability: }The system will be able to adapt to different scenarios and recover accordingly.\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Availability: }Due to the nature of the system, the system must be available 24/7 when needed.\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Maintainability: }Upon failure, error notifications will be sent out to the correct departments so that they may be able to fix the problem.\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Portability: }As cloud servers should be hosted on computers, portability is limited. An executable can be run on a new computer to set up a new node in the cloud cluster. \par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Reliability: }The system should have a 99.9$\%$  uptime per year. This means that downtime should equal to only a couple of minutes per year. \par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Robustness: }The system will have measures in place on certain scenarios of system failure.\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Testability: }A self-diagnose function is implemented in each server node to check the health of the system. \par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\textbf{Usability: }The system is designed to be user-friendly but the nurses and doctors that use this system should still be trained before doing so.\par
